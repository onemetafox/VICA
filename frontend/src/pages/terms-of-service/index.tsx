            About ViCA and its Services
          </h2>
          <Paragraph>
            ViCA is a leading peer-to-peer marketplace to facilitate the
            purchase and sale of Digital Assets with sellers accepting more than
            300 payment methods in exchange for their Digital Assets. Payment
            methods are negotiated and exchanged on a peer-to-peer basis between
            the buyers in the Marketplace (<strong>“Buyers”</strong>) and
            sellers in the Marketplace (<strong>“Sellers”</strong>). Our users
            agree upon which payment methods to use to complete a transaction
            and are fully responsible and liable for using such payment methods
            in a lawful manner.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            ViCA also offers hosted digital wallet services through a leading
            global digital asset wallet provider. Our worldwide userbase is able
            to post offers to either buy or sell Digital Assets in a variety of
            convenient methods. The creator of the offer is responsible for
            listing terms of the transaction, including the payment methods the
            Seller will accept. Once an offer is selected by another ViCA user,
            the Seller’s Digital Assets are locked as part of our transaction
            procedures (which we refer to as “ViCA Escrow”) until all conditions
            necessary to consummate the transaction have occurred. The sale is
            complete and Digital Assets are unlocked and released to the Buyer
            by the Seller once the Buyer has completed the terms of the
            transaction and payment has been confirmed valid and received by the
            Seller. ViCA DOES NOT ACT AS A PAYMENT PROCESSOR. ALL LIABILITY FOR
            SENDING AND RECEIVING PAYMENT AND CONFIRMING THE VALIDITY OF THE
            TRANSACTIONS LIE BETWEEN THE BUYER AND SELLER. The Digital Assets we
            lock are released back to the Seller if the Buyer chooses to cancel
            the transaction. The Seller may not cancel the transaction at any
            point. The Seller only has the option to unlock the Digital Assets
            and release it to the Buyer. This is for the security protection for
            the Buyer. Should a Seller need to cancel the transaction due to a
            Buyer not following the terms of the transaction, they must start a
            dispute and provide a reason for doing so as further described in
            Section 8 of this Agreement. Transactions on our Website are
            conducted between the Buyers and Sellers. Accordingly, ViCA is not a
            party to any transaction.

            The hosted digital currency wallet service provided by ViCA is a
            secure method of storing, sending, and receiving digital currency.
            ViCA does not store or custody any Digital Assets. Digital Assets
            are always stored on its respective networks or blockchains. All
            digital currency transactions occur within the digital currency
            network, not on ViCA. There are no guarantees that the transaction
            will process on the digital currency network. ViCA reserves the
            right to refuse to process any transaction if required by law or if
            we deem the transactions to be against our terms and conditions in
            this Agreement. You hereby accept and acknowledge that you take full
            responsibility for all activities that occur under your wallet and
            accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your
            wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

                    TRIAL BY JURY AND YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE
                    IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST ViCA.
                  </Paragraph>
                  <Paragraph>
                    The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies
                    to the arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a
                    single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the State
                    of Delaware, or another mutually agreeable location, in the
                    English language. The arbitrator may award any relief that a
                    court of competent jurisdiction could award, including
                    attorneys’ fees when authorized by law, and the arbitral
                    decision may be entered as a judgement and enforced in any
                    court of law. At your request, hearings may be conducted in
                    person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for
                    submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral
                    hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding
                    to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and
                    attorneys’ fees.
                  </Paragraph>
                  <Paragraph>
                    If the arbitrator(s) or arbitration administrator would
                    impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we
                    will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or
                    costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to
                    pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also
                    pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the
                    arbitration administrator’s rules or applicable law. Apart
                    from the foregoing, each party will be responsible for any
                    other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the party
                    may incur.

                  If any part of this Agreement is held by any arbitrator or
                  court of United States to be invalid or unenforceable in whole
                  or in part, the validity or enforceability of the other
                  sections of these terms and conditions shall not be affected.

                  We do not own or control the underlying software protocols
                  which govern the operation of Digital Assets. Generally, the
                  underlying protocols are open source, and anyone can use,
                  copy, modify, and distribute them. We assume no responsibility
                  for the operation of the underlying protocols and we are not
                  able to guarantee the functionality or security of network
                  operations. In particular, the underlying protocols may be
                  subject to sudden changes in operating rules (including
                  “forks”). Any such material operating changes may materially
                  affect the availability, value, functionality, and/or the name
                  of such digital currency. ViCA does not control the timing and
                  features of these material operating changes. It is your
                  responsibility to make yourself aware of upcoming operating
                  changes and you must carefully consider publicly available
                  information and information that may be provided by ViCA in
                  determining whether to continue to use the Services. In the
                  event of any such operational change, ViCA reserves the right
                  to take such steps as may be necessary to protect the security
                  and safe operation of its platform, including temporarily
                  suspending operations for the involved digital currency(ies),
                  and other necessary steps. ViCA will use its reasonable
                  efforts to provide you notice of its response to any material
                  operating change; however, such changes are outside of our
                  control and may occur without notice to ViCA. Our response to
                  any material operating change is subject to our sole
                  discretion and includes deciding not to support any new fork
                  or other actions. You acknowledge and accept the risks of
                  operating changes to Digital Assets’ protocols and agree that
                  ViCA is not responsible for such operating changes and not
                  liable for any loss of value you may experience as a result of
                  such changes in operating rules. You acknowledge and accept
                  that ViCA has sole discretion to determine its response to any
                  operating change and that we have no responsibility to assist
                  you with unsupported currencies or protocols.
